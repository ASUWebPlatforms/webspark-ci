# ASU Governance

## Introduction
The asu_governance module is intended to provide Enterprise Technology with a way to manage the governance of Drupal sites on the Acquia platform.
This module provides the following:
- A curated "ASU Modules" interface to replace the stock "Extend" modules page in Drupal. This will allow Site Administrators to limit the ability of Site Builders to enable/disable and configure only the modules that have been approved by Enterprise Technology.
- A curated "ASU Themes" interface to replace the stock "Appearance" themes page in Drupal. This will allow Site Administrators to limit the ability of Site Builders to enable/disable and configure only the themes that have been approved by Enterprise Technology.

## Requirements
This module is intended to be used only on ASU Drupal sites hosted on the Acquia platform.

## Installation
Install as you would normally install a contributed Drupal module.
See: https://www.drupal.org/node/895232 for further information.

## Configuration
- Site Administrators will have access to the "ASU Governance settings" page located in the System submenu of the Configuration menu.
