# Webspark Blocks

The Webspark Blocks module provides a number of components and their configuration for Webspark.

The configuration is set as readonly so the components can't be altered from the UI.

## Installation instructions
The Webspark Blocks module installs when you create a Webspark site.

The main purpose of these components is to have them placed in the page using the layout builder.
To place any component, go to the layout builder -> Add block -> Create custom block,
and choose the component that you want to use.
